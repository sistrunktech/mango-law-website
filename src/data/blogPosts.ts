    content: `Operating a vehicle under the influence (OVI) is the legal term Ohio uses for what many other states call DUI (Driving Under the Influence). Whether you're facing a first offense or have prior convictions, understanding the charges and penalties is critical.

## What is OVI in Ohio?

OVI stands for "Operating a Vehicle Impaired." You can be charged with OVI if you operate any vehicle—car, motorcycle, boat, or even bicycle—while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both.

## Penalties for OVI

First-time OVI offenses can result in:
- 3 days to 6 months in jail
- Fines ranging from $375 to $1,075
- License suspension from 6 months to 3 years
- Mandatory alcohol or drug treatment programs
- Ignition interlock device installation

## How We Can Help

At Mango Law, we challenge every aspect of an OVI charge:
- Validity of the traffic stop
- Proper administration of field sobriety tests
- Calibration and accuracy of breathalyzer equipment
- Chain of custody for blood samples
- Officer training and testimony

Early intervention is key. Contact us immediately if you've been charged with OVI.`,

    title: 'The Power of Motion Practice in Criminal Defense',
    excerpt: 'Discover how strategic pre-trial motions can suppress evidence, dismiss charges, or significantly improve your case outcome.',
    imageUrl: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/8111855/pexels-photo-8111855.jpeg',
    content: `Motion practice is one of the most powerful tools in criminal defense. Many cases are won or significantly improved before trial through properly crafted and argued motions.

## What Are Pre-Trial Motions?

Pre-trial motions are formal requests filed with the court asking for specific rulings before your case goes to trial. These can challenge the admissibility of evidence, the legality of searches and seizures, or even the validity of the charges themselves.

## Common Defense Motions

### Motion to Suppress Evidence
If law enforcement violated your constitutional rights during a search or seizure, we can file a motion to suppress that evidence. Without key evidence, prosecutors often must reduce charges or dismiss the case entirely.

### Motion to Dismiss
When charges lack legal foundation or were improperly filed, a motion to dismiss can end your case without trial.

### Motion in Limine
These motions prevent prejudicial or irrelevant evidence from being presented to a jury, ensuring you receive a fair trial.

## Why Motion Practice Matters

Effective motion practice can:
- Result in evidence suppression that weakens the prosecution's case
- Lead to charge reduction or dismissal
- Establish favorable legal precedents for trial
- Demonstrate preparation and seriousness to prosecutors
- Save you time, money, and stress

## Our Approach

At Mango Law, we meticulously review discovery materials, identify constitutional violations, and file well-researched motions backed by Ohio case law. Our experience with Delaware and Franklin County courts means we know what works and how to present it effectively.

If you're facing charges, don't wait. Early motion practice can make all the difference.`,

    excerpt: 'Learn the critical differences between possession and trafficking charges in Ohio, and how these distinctions affect your defense strategy.',
    imageUrl: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/5668842/pexels-photo-5668842.jpeg',
    content: `Ohio drug laws distinguish between simple possession and drug trafficking, with dramatically different penalties and defense strategies required for each charge.

## Drug Possession in Ohio

Possession charges apply when you're found with controlled substances for personal use. Penalties depend on:
- The type of drug (schedule)
- The amount possessed
- Your criminal history
- Whether aggravating circumstances exist

## Drug Trafficking Charges

Trafficking involves the sale, distribution, or intent to distribute controlled substances. Unlike many states, Ohio doesn't require proof of actual sale—possession of certain quantities creates a presumption of trafficking.

## Key Factors in Trafficking Charges

### Amount Matters
Ohio has specific weight thresholds called "bulk amounts" that trigger trafficking charges. For example:
- 5 grams or more of cocaine
- 1 gram or more of heroin
- 200 grams or more of marijuana

### Circumstantial Evidence
Prosecutors often rely on:
- Large amounts of cash
- Scales or baggies
- Multiple cell phones
- Text messages suggesting sales

## Defense Strategies

### For Possession Cases
- Challenge the legality of the search
- Question chain of custody
- Explore diversion programs
- Negotiate for treatment instead of jail

### For Trafficking Cases
- Argue against trafficking presumptions
- Challenge quantity measurements
- Dispute intent to distribute
- Examine confidential informant reliability

## Treatment Alternatives

Ohio offers intervention in lieu of conviction for eligible defendants. This can result in charges being dismissed after completing a treatment program.

## Why You Need Experienced Defense

Drug charges carry mandatory penalties in many cases, and prosecutors aggressively pursue convictions. At Mango Law, we've successfully defended hundreds of drug cases by challenging search procedures, questioning lab results, and negotiating favorable outcomes.

    excerpt: 'Learn your rights regarding field sobriety tests in Ohio, the consequences of refusal, and how this decision affects your OVI defense strategy.',
    imageUrl: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/8815997/pexels-photo-8815997.jpeg',
    content: `If you've been pulled over for suspected OVI/DUI in Ohio, one of the most important decisions you'll make is whether to perform field sobriety tests. Unlike chemical tests, **you have the right to refuse field sobriety tests in Ohio**—but understanding the implications is critical.

## What Are Field Sobriety Tests?

Field sobriety tests (FSTs) are physical and cognitive exercises that officers use to evaluate whether a driver is impaired. These are different from chemical tests (breath, blood, or urine) and are typically administered roadside before an arrest.

### Common Field Sobriety Tests

**Standardized Tests (NHTSA-Approved)**:
- Horizontal Gaze Nystagmus (HGN): Officer tracks your eye movements
- Walk-and-Turn: Walk heel-to-toe in a straight line
- One-Leg Stand: Stand on one leg while counting

**Non-Standardized Tests**:
- Alphabet recitation
- Finger-to-nose
- Romberg balance test
- Counting backwards

## Your Right to Refuse

**You can refuse field sobriety tests in Ohio without direct legal penalties.** There is no statute requiring you to perform these tests, and refusal cannot be used as the sole basis for arrest or license suspension.

### No Implied Consent for FSTs

Ohio's implied consent law (ORC 4511.191) applies only to chemical tests—not field sobriety tests. You are under no legal obligation to perform physical roadside exercises.

## Why Officers Want You to Perform FSTs

Field sobriety tests serve one primary purpose: building evidence for prosecution. Officers use FST results to:

- Establish probable cause for arrest
- Document signs of impairment
- Create video evidence for trial
- Justify chemical testing

**Critical point**: FSTs are inherently subjective. The officer decides whether you pass or fail.

## Consequences of Refusal vs. Performance

### If You Refuse

- Officer notes refusal in report
- May still be arrested based on other observations
- Refusal cannot be mentioned at trial (in most circumstances)
- No automatic license suspension or penalties

### If You Perform

- Everything you do becomes evidence
- Officer's interpretation becomes fact
- Video footage can be used against you
- May still be arrested regardless of performance

## How Refusal Affects Your Defense

Refusal often benefits your defense by:

- Eliminating video evidence of stumbling
- Removing officer testimony about FST failure
- Forcing prosecution to rely on weaker evidence
- Limiting subjective interpretation

## What About Chemical Tests?

**Chemical test refusal is different** and carries serious consequences:

- Automatic 1-year license suspension (first refusal)
- Refusal can be mentioned at trial
- Separate administrative penalties

Many attorneys advise performing chemical tests even if you've refused FSTs.

## Delaware and Franklin County Considerations

Local law enforcement in Delaware County and Franklin County frequently patrol US-23 and SR-315. Understanding your rights before a stop is crucial. Delaware Municipal Court and Delaware County Court of Common Pleas hear hundreds of OVI cases annually, and experienced local counsel makes a significant difference.

## When to Contact an Attorney

If you've been arrested for OVI in Delaware or Franklin County:

- Don't wait—evidence degrades and deadlines approach
- Don't represent yourself—OVI law is complex
- Don't assume conviction is inevitable—many defenses exist

At Mango Law, we challenge every aspect of OVI cases: traffic stop legality, FST administration, chemical test accuracy, and constitutional violations.

    title: 'Ohio DUI Lookback Period: How Past Convictions Affect Your Case',
    excerpt: 'Understanding Ohio\'s 10-year lookback period for OVI offenses and how prior convictions impact penalties, license suspension, and sentencing.',
    imageUrl: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/5668772/pexels-photo-5668772.jpeg',
    content: `If you're facing OVI/DUI charges in Ohio and have a prior conviction on your record, understanding the **lookback period** is critical. Ohio uses a 10-year window to determine whether your current offense counts as a repeat violation—and the difference in penalties is dramatic.

## What Is the Lookback Period?

The lookback period (also called the "washout period") is the timeframe during which prior OVI convictions count toward enhanced penalties for subsequent offenses.

**In Ohio, the lookback period is 10 years** (previously it was 6 years until 2017).

### How It Works

Ohio counts prior OVI convictions that occurred within **10 years** of your current offense date. If your last conviction was more than 10 years ago, your new charge is treated as a first offense for sentencing purposes.

**Important**: The 10 years is calculated from the date of the prior offense to the date of the current offense—not from conviction date to conviction date.

## Why the Lookback Period Matters

The number of prior convictions within the lookback period dramatically affects penalties:

### First Offense OVI (No Priors in 10 Years)

- **Jail**: 3 days minimum to 6 months maximum
- **Fine**: $375 to $1,075
- **License Suspension**: 6 months to 3 years
- **Vehicle Immobilization**: Optional
- **Ignition Interlock**: Possible but not mandatory

### Second Offense OVI (One Prior in 10 Years)

- **Jail**: 10 days minimum to 6 months maximum (mandatory consecutive days)
- **Fine**: $525 to $1,625
- **License Suspension**: 1 to 7 years
- **Vehicle Immobilization**: 90 days (or forfeiture)
- **Ignition Interlock**: Mandatory
- **License Plates**: Immobilized or impounded
- **Yellow "Party Plates"**: Likely required

### Third Offense OVI (Two Priors in 10 Years)

- **Jail**: 30 days minimum to 1 year maximum (mandatory consecutive days)
- **Fine**: $850 to $2,750
- **License Suspension**: 2 to 12 years
- **Vehicle Forfeiture**: Mandatory (vehicle seized and sold)
- **Ignition Interlock**: Mandatory for life
- **Yellow Plates**: Required
- **Possible Felony**: Certain circumstances elevate to felony

### Fourth or More Offenses

Fourth and subsequent OVI offenses within 10 years are typically charged as **felonies** with even harsher penalties including:

- State prison time (6 months to several years)
- Permanent license revocation
- Significant fines and costs
- Felony record affecting employment, housing, voting rights

## High-Test OVI and Enhanced Penalties

Even within the lookback period, **high BAC results** trigger enhanced mandatory minimums:

### First Offense High-Test (BAC .170+)

- 3 additional mandatory jail days (6 days total minimum)
- Mandatory yellow plates
- Longer license suspension
- Mandatory ignition interlock

### Second Offense High-Test

- 20 additional mandatory jail days (30 days total minimum)
- Extended license suspension
- Higher fines

## What Counts as a Prior Conviction?

For lookback purposes, Ohio counts:

- **Prior Ohio OVI/DUI convictions**
- **Out-of-state DUI convictions** (including other states' equivalents)
- **Physical control convictions** (ORC 4511.194)
- **Reckless operation plea deals** (if originally charged as OVI)
- **Municipal and common pleas court convictions**

### What Doesn't Count

- Diversions that were successfully completed and dismissed
- Charges that were reduced and never included an OVI conviction
- Convictions more than 10 years old

**Critical**: Prosecutors will pull your **Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) certified driving record** to establish priors. Any conviction within 10 years will be used against you.

## The 2017 Law Change

### Old Law (Pre-2017)

- Lookback period was **6 years**
- Many defendants with older priors could qualify for first-offense treatment

### New Law (2017-Present)

- Lookback period extended to **10 years**
- Significantly more defendants face enhanced penalties
- Prior convictions from 6-10 years ago now count

### Why It Changed

Legislators argued that the 6-year window was too short to deter repeat offenders and that extending it would improve public safety. Critics note it increases mass incarceration and disproportionately affects people who've been sober for years.

## Strategies When You Have Priors

### Challenge the Prior Conviction

Sometimes prior convictions can be challenged:

- **Constitutional violations**: Was your right to counsel violated?
- **Procedural errors**: Was the prior conviction properly recorded?
- **Jurisdiction issues**: Was it actually within 10 years?
- **Invalid guilty plea**: Was it knowing and voluntary?

Excluding a prior conviction can mean the difference between first-offense and second-offense penalties.

### Challenge the Current Charge

Even with priors, you can fight the current charge:

- Illegal traffic stop
- Improper field sobriety tests
- Breathalyzer calibration issues
- Blood draw procedural violations
- Rising BAC defense
- Mouth alcohol contamination

**Winning the current case eliminates the enhanced penalty risk.**

### Negotiate Strategic Pleas

Experienced OVI attorneys can negotiate outcomes that:

- Avoid conviction (diversion, dismissal)
- Reduce to reckless operation (doesn't count as OVI prior)
- Minimize jail time and fines
- Preserve driving privileges
- Avoid ignition interlock

### Explore Diversion Programs

Some defendants with priors may still qualify for:

- Intervention in lieu of conviction (ILC)
- Treatment-focused sentencing
- Problem-solving courts (DUI court, drug court)

These programs focus on rehabilitation rather than incarceration.

## Impact on License Suspension

Prior convictions dramatically increase license suspension length:

### First Offense

- 6 months to 3 years (depending on refusal, high-test, other factors)

### Second Offense

- 1 year minimum to 7 years maximum

### Third Offense

- 2 years minimum to 12 years maximum

### Fourth+ Offense

- Permanent revocation possible

### Administrative License Suspension (ALS)

Remember, the ALS suspension runs separately and immediately:

- First refusal: 1 year
- Second refusal: 2 years
- High-test first offense: 90 days

These suspensions run concurrently with criminal suspensions in some cases but not always. Understanding the interaction requires experienced counsel.

## Employment and Professional Consequences

Multiple OVI convictions create compounding employment issues:

### Commercial Driver's License (CDL)

- First OVI: 1-year CDL disqualification
- Second OVI: **Lifetime CDL disqualification**
- No lookback period exception for CDL holders

### Professional Licenses

Multiple convictions may trigger:

- Medical license discipline
- Law license suspension
- Teaching license revocation
- Real estate license consequences
- Financial services licensing issues

### Background Checks

Multiple convictions appearing on background checks create serious barriers to:

- Employment
- Housing
- Professional opportunities
- Volunteer positions
- Educational opportunities

## Out-of-State Convictions

### Interstate Driver's License Compact

Ohio participates in the Interstate Driver's License Compact, meaning:

- Out-of-state DUI convictions **count toward Ohio's lookback**
- Ohio will report your Ohio conviction to your home state
- License suspensions are enforced across states

### Common Scenarios

**Michigan DUI + Ohio OVI**: Both count toward the lookback

**Pennsylvania DUI + Pennsylvania DUI + Ohio OVI**: Third offense penalties apply

**California DUI 11 years ago + Ohio OVI today**: First offense treatment

## Felony OVI Threshold

### When Does OVI Become a Felony?

OVI can be elevated to a felony in several scenarios:

#### Fourth Offense Within 10 Years

- Felony of the fourth degree
- 6-30 months in prison
- Permanent license consequences

#### OVI with Certain Prior Felonies

If you have prior felony OVI convictions, subsequent offenses may be enhanced:

- Third-degree felony: 9-36 months prison
- Significant fines

#### OVI Causing Serious Physical Harm

- Fourth-degree felony (first offense)
- Third-degree felony (with priors)

#### OVI Causing Death

- Vehicular homicide
- Second or first-degree felony
- Mandatory prison time

## Special Considerations for Multiple Priors

### Ignition Interlock Device

With multiple priors, ignition interlock becomes:

- **Mandatory** (not optional)
- **Longer duration** (often several years)
- **More expensive** (monitoring fees add up)
- **Monitoring requirements** (monthly calibration, photo verification)

### Yellow "Party Plates"

Second and subsequent offenses within 10 years require:

- Yellow plates with red lettering
- Registered in your name
- Visible marker of OVI conviction
- Social stigma and embarrassment

### Vehicle Forfeiture

Third offense within 10 years triggers **mandatory vehicle forfeiture**:

- Police seize your vehicle
- Vehicle is sold at auction
- Proceeds go to law enforcement
- **You lose the car permanently**

**Critical**: This applies even if the vehicle belongs to a family member in some cases. Protecting your assets requires immediate legal intervention.

## Delaware and Franklin County Specific Considerations

### Local Court Practices

**Delaware Municipal Court** and **Delaware County Court of Common Pleas** handle hundreds of repeat OVI cases. Local factors include:

- Prosecutor policies on plea negotiations
- Judicial tendencies on sentencing
- Availability of diversion programs
- Access to problem-solving courts

### Highway Patrol Presence

US-23 and SR-315 see heavy Ohio State Highway Patrol enforcement. Troopers:

- Use advanced detection equipment
- Follow standardized procedures
- Have extensive OVI training
- Create thorough documentation

Multiple encounters with the same agency can hurt your credibility—experienced local counsel understands the landscape.

## Protecting Your Future with Priors

### Immediate Steps After Arrest

1. **Don't discuss the case** with anyone except your attorney
2. **Write down everything** you remember
3. **Gather evidence**: receipts, witness info, location details
4. **Contact an attorney immediately**—time matters
5. **Preserve your BMV record**—request certified copy

### Long-Term Strategies

1. **Complete treatment proactively**—shows rehabilitation
2. **Maintain sobriety**—monitored compliance helps
3. **Address underlying issues**—counseling, mental health treatment
4. **Build character evidence**—employment, community service
5. **Stay out of trouble**—any new charges worsen your situation

## Why You Need an Experienced OVI Attorney

Repeat OVI offenses require sophisticated legal representation:

### Technical Defenses

- Constitutional challenges to prior convictions
- Challenging stop legality
- Attacking test reliability
- Suppressing evidence
- Expert witness testimony

### Strategic Negotiation

- Understanding prosecutor policies
- Knowing judicial tendencies
- Leveraging treatment completion
- Timing negotiations strategically
- Preserving appeal rights

### Damage Control

Even if conviction is likely:

- Minimize jail time
- Reduce fines and costs
- Protect employment
- Preserve limited driving privileges
- Avoid vehicle forfeiture
- Structure payment plans

## Common Myths About the Lookback Period

### Myth: "It resets after 10 years automatically"

**Reality**: The lookback applies at the time of the new offense. A conviction from year 9 still counts. Only after 10 years plus one day does it fall outside the window.

### Myth: "Out-of-state convictions don't count"

**Reality**: Ohio absolutely counts out-of-state DUI convictions toward the lookback.

### Myth: "Reckless op doesn't count"

**Reality**: If you pled to reckless operation from an original OVI charge, prosecutors may still use it depending on circumstances.

### Myth: "Diversion means no prior"

**Reality**: Successfully completed diversions generally don't count, but failed diversions that result in conviction absolutely count.

## The Cost of Multiple OVIs

### Direct Costs

- Fines: $525-$2,750+ per offense
- Court costs: $200-$500
- Attorney fees: $2,500-$10,000+
- Ignition interlock: $75-$150/month (years of monitoring)
- SR-22 insurance: 2-3x normal rates for 3-5 years
- License reinstatement: $475+
- Vehicle forfeiture: Entire vehicle value

### Indirect Costs

- Lost wages during jail time
- Employment termination
- Increased insurance (can exceed $10,000 over time)
- Transportation alternatives (rideshare, taxi)
- Treatment programs
- Career setbacks
- Professional license consequences

**Total cost of second OVI**: Often $15,000-$30,000
**Total cost of third OVI**: Often $25,000-$50,000+

## Conclusion

Ohio's 10-year OVI lookback period means prior convictions significantly impact your current case. The difference between first-offense and repeat-offense penalties is dramatic—enhanced jail time, longer suspensions, mandatory ignition interlock, yellow plates, and potential vehicle forfeiture.

If you're facing OVI charges with priors in Delaware or Franklin County:

- **Time is critical**—evidence preservation and deadlines matter
- **Don't represent yourself**—the stakes are too high
- **Challenge everything**—prior convictions, current evidence, procedures
- **Explore all options**—diversion, plea negotiations, trial

    excerpt: 'Hit with an ex parte CPO in Ohio? You were never heard, but your life changed anyway. Learn what these orders mean, why they feel so unfair, and how to defend yourself at the full hearing.',
    imageUrl: 'https://images.pexels.com/photos/6077326/pexels-photo-6077326.jpeg',
    content: `If you've been served with an ex parte civil protection order in Delaware or Franklin County, you know the feeling: blindsided. You received court papers. Someone made allegations. A judge signed an order. You've been removed from your home, told to stay away from someone, maybe even forced to surrender your firearms—and you never got to say a word in your defense.

Ex parte protection orders are issued without you being present. No attorney. No testimony. No chance to explain what actually happened. The petitioner tells their side of the story, and the judge decides based only on what they hear in that moment. By the time you find out, the order is already in effect.

It feels fundamentally unfair because it is. But it's how the system works, and you need to understand what you're up against.

## What Is an Ex Parte Protection Order?

Under Ohio Revised Code § 3113.31, courts can issue civil protection orders (CPOs) in cases involving domestic violence. "Ex parte" means "from one side"—the order is issued based solely on the petitioner's allegations, without the accused being notified or given a chance to respond.

The law allows this because courts are supposed to act quickly when someone claims they're in immediate danger. The petitioner goes to court, fills out paperwork detailing alleged incidents of violence or threats, and asks for emergency relief. If the judge finds the petition shows enough evidence of danger, they issue a temporary ex parte order on the spot.

### What an Ex Parte Order Can Do

Even though it's temporary, an ex parte CPO can:

- **Prohibit you from contacting the petitioner** (no calls, texts, emails, social media, or third-party contact)
- **Order you to move out of your home**, even if you own it or pay rent
- **Restrict your contact with your children**, especially if they live with the petitioner
- **Require you to surrender all firearms and ammunition immediately**
- **Order you to stay away from the petitioner's home, workplace, and school**

These restrictions take effect immediately upon service. Violating any term—even accidentally—is a separate criminal offense under ORC § 2919.27 and can result in arrest and jail time.

## Why Ex Parte Orders Feel So Unfair

### The Judge Only Heard One Side

At the ex parte hearing, you weren't there. Your attorney wasn't there. No one cross-examined the petitioner. The judge made a decision based entirely on allegations—not tested evidence.

The petitioner's story may be exaggerated, distorted, or outright false. It doesn't matter. The order goes into effect anyway.

### Allegations, Not Proof, Drive the Decision

To get an ex parte order, the petitioner doesn't have to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt or even by clear and convincing evidence. They just need to convince the judge that there's enough of a concern to justify temporary protection.

This is an extremely low bar. Sworn statements, even if contradicted by texts, emails, or witness accounts you could provide, are often enough.

### Your Life Changes Overnight

You may have been ordered out of your own home. You might not be able to see your kids. If you had guns for hunting or sport, they're gone. Your employer might find out, or the order might show up in a background check. You can't call the petitioner to try to work things out, even if the relationship was fine yesterday and this came out of nowhere.

All of this happens before you ever get a chance to defend yourself.

## Common Misuses and "Tactical" CPOs

Protection orders exist for a reason: genuine victims of domestic violence need legal tools to protect themselves. But the system can be—and is—misused.

### Leverage in Divorce or Custody Cases

CPOs are sometimes filed right before or during divorce proceedings to gain an advantage. If you're ordered out of the marital home and prohibited from seeing your children, the petitioner has de facto control over living arrangements and custody while the family law case is pending.

By the time the divorce is final, the other side has established a status quo that family courts are reluctant to disturb.

### Getting Someone Out of Shared Housing

Ex parte orders can force you to leave a home you own or lease, even if the petitioner has no legal right to exclude you. If the relationship ended badly and the other person wants you gone, a CPO can accomplish that without going through eviction or lease disputes.

### Retaliation After a Breakup

Some CPOs are filed as payback. An argument, a breakup, or a new relationship can trigger a filing that exaggerates or fabricates incidents to justify the order. The petitioner may be angry, hurt, or trying to control you—and the legal system provides a mechanism to do it.

### Misunderstandings and Overreactions

Not every misuse is malicious. Sometimes petitioners genuinely believe they're in danger based on a misunderstanding, emotional distress, or a single heated argument. They go to court scared, present their perspective, and the judge errs on the side of caution. The result is the same: you're under a court order based on a distorted version of events.

None of this means that most CPO filings are illegitimate. Many are necessary and life-saving. But when the process is misused—whether intentionally or not—you bear the consequences.

## Immediate Do's and Don'ts When Served

The moment you're served with an ex parte CPO, your actions matter. Mistakes now can hurt you at the full hearing.

### Do Not Contact the Petitioner

This is the #1 rule. Even if the allegations are false. Even if you just want to talk. Even if the petitioner reaches out to you first.

Any contact—direct or indirect—violates the order and can result in criminal charges under ORC § 2919.27. Prosecutors treat CPO violations seriously. A conviction can mean jail time, additional protection orders, and a criminal record.

### Do Not Try to "Tell Your Side" Over Text or Social Media

If you send a long text explaining what "really happened" or post on social media about the situation, those messages can and will be used against you. They can be presented as evidence of harassment, obsession, or continued threats.

Courts don't see these messages as your attempt to clear your name. They see them as violations of the no-contact order or evidence that you're not taking the allegations seriously.

### Do Keep Records of Everything

From the moment you're served, document everything:

- **Your whereabouts**: Where were you during the incidents alleged in the petition? Can anyone confirm?
- **Communications**: Gather all texts, emails, voicemails, and social media messages between you and the petitioner. These often contradict the narrative in the petition.
- **Witnesses**: Who saw what happened? Who can speak to your relationship, your behavior, or the petitioner's behavior?
- **Evidence of motives**: Is there a pending divorce? A custody dispute? Did the petitioner recently tell you to move out?

The more evidence you preserve now, the stronger your defense at the full hearing.

### Do Surrender Firearms Immediately

If the order requires you to surrender firearms, do so right away. Failing to comply is a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8) and can result in federal charges on top of state CPO violations.

Surrender your firearms to law enforcement or a federally licensed dealer as directed by the order. Keep documentation showing you complied.

### Do Bring All of This to an Attorney

The ex parte order will list a date for a full hearing, usually within 7-10 days. That's when you'll finally have a chance to present your side. But you need to be ready, and you need experienced legal help to prepare.

## The Full Hearing: Your Chance to Be Heard

The full hearing is your opportunity to contest the protection order. Unlike the ex parte stage, you have the right to appear, present evidence, call witnesses, and cross-examine the petitioner.

### Burden of Proof

At the full hearing, the petitioner must prove their case by a **preponderance of the evidence**—meaning it's more likely than not that you committed the acts alleged in the petition. This is a civil standard, lower than the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard in criminal cases.

If the petitioner meets this burden, the court can issue a civil protection order that lasts up to five years. If they don't, the order is dismissed.

### What Happens at the Hearing

Both sides present testimony and evidence. You (or your attorney) can:

- **Cross-examine the petitioner**, asking questions designed to expose inconsistencies, exaggerations, or fabrications
- **Present your own testimony**, explaining what actually happened and refuting the allegations
- **Call witnesses**, including people who were present during alleged incidents or who can speak to your character and the petitioner's behavior
- **Introduce documents**, such as text messages, emails, photos, and location data that contradict the petitioner's claims

The judge listens to both sides and makes a decision.

### Cross-Examination Is Critical

Cross-examination is where many CPO cases are won or lost. Petitioners often make statements in the petition that sound damning but fall apart under questioning. Dates and times don't match up. Descriptions conflict with physical evidence. Motives become clear.

An experienced attorney knows how to ask the right questions, stay within the rules of evidence, and systematically undermine the petitioner's credibility without appearing aggressive or disrespectful.

### Presenting Your Defense

You need to tell your side clearly and credibly. That means:

- **Sticking to the facts**: No embellishing, no rambling, no getting emotional.
- **Acknowledging what you can't deny**: If there was an argument, say so. Trying to pretend everything was perfect looks dishonest.
- **Providing context**: Arguments happen. Context matters. If the petitioner is leaving out critical details, you need to fill them in.
- **Calling corroborating witnesses**: If your roommate, friend, or family member can confirm your version of events, bring them.

Judges see CPO hearings all day. They can tell the difference between someone who's being truthful and someone who's spinning a story.

## Collateral Consequences You Can't Ignore

Even if the petitioner's allegations seem overblown and you're confident you'll win at the hearing, take this seriously. The consequences of a permanent protection order go far beyond being told to stay away from someone.

### Loss of Firearm Rights

Under federal law (18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8)), if you're subject to a qualifying domestic violence protection order, you **cannot possess, purchase, or transport firearms or ammunition**. This applies even if you're a law-abiding gun owner with no criminal record.

Ohio law mirrors this prohibition. Violating it is a federal felony.

If you hunt, collect firearms, or own guns for personal protection, a permanent CPO means those rights are gone for the duration of the order—potentially five years.

### Professional License Risks

Many professional licenses require disclosure of protection orders, especially in healthcare, education, and law enforcement. Nurses, teachers, counselors, and first responders may face disciplinary proceedings or license suspension if a CPO is issued against them.

Even if your employer doesn't find out immediately, many jobs require periodic background checks. A CPO on your record can cost you your career.

### Background Checks and Public Records

CPOs are public records. They show up in:

- **Employment background checks**: Employers often view protection orders as red flags.
- **Housing applications**: Landlords can deny applications based on protection orders.
- **Professional certifications and clearances**: Many fields require clean records.

A CPO doesn't disappear when it expires. It remains part of the public record indefinitely.

### Impact on Custody and Family Law Proceedings

If you're involved in a custody dispute, a CPO can be devastating. Family courts take protection orders seriously when deciding custody and parenting time. Even if the CPO is based on exaggerated or false claims, the fact that a judge issued one at all can hurt your position.

### Stigma and Reputation

Being subject to a protection order carries social stigma. People assume you're dangerous, abusive, or unstable. It affects personal relationships, professional opportunities, and how you're perceived in your community.

## How Mango Law Handles CPO Defense

We've represented clients in ex parte protection order cases in Delaware County Domestic Relations Court and Franklin County. We understand the stakes. We know these cases are often emotionally charged, factually complicated, and legally consequential.

### Early Case Review

As soon as you're served with an ex parte order, we review the petition in detail. We identify inconsistencies, gaps, and weak points. We look at the timeline, the allegations, and what the petitioner is really trying to accomplish.

We also assess whether the order was properly issued under ORC § 3113.31. Not every case qualifies for a CPO. If the petitioner doesn't meet the legal standard, we move to dismiss.

### Evidence Gathering

We work with you to collect every piece of evidence that supports your defense:

- **Text messages and emails**: Often the best evidence. They show the tone of the relationship, contradict allegations, or reveal the petitioner's motives.
- **Witness statements**: People who were present during alleged incidents or who know both parties.
- **Location data**: GPS, receipts, work records—anything that shows you weren't where the petitioner claims you were.
- **Photos and videos**: Visual evidence that contradicts the petitioner's claims.

We also look for evidence of ulterior motives: pending divorce filings, custody disputes, property disputes, or threats the petitioner made before filing the CPO.

### Cross-Examination Preparation

We prepare to cross-examine the petitioner strategically. That means knowing the facts better than they do, anticipating their answers, and asking questions that expose problems with their story.

Cross-examination isn't about being aggressive or hostile. It's about methodically showing the judge that the petitioner's version of events doesn't hold up.

### Coordination with Related Criminal Cases

If the petitioner has also filed criminal charges (assault, domestic violence, menacing), we coordinate your CPO defense with your criminal defense strategy. What you say in the CPO hearing can be used against you in the criminal case, and vice versa.

We make sure your testimony is consistent, your defenses align, and you're not inadvertently creating problems in one case while defending the other.

### Presenting Your Case

At the hearing, we present a clear, factual defense. We call witnesses, introduce documents, and tell your side of the story in a way that's credible and persuasive.

We also make legal arguments when appropriate—challenging the sufficiency of the petitioner's evidence, the applicability of ORC § 3113.31, and the legal standard for issuing a permanent order.

## Relevant Ohio Statutes

Understanding the legal framework is critical:

- **ORC § 3113.31**: Authorizes courts to issue civil protection orders in domestic violence cases, including ex parte orders.
- **ORC § 2919.27**: Makes it a criminal offense to violate a protection order. First violation is typically a first-degree misdemeanor; subsequent violations can be felonies.
- **ORC § 2903.214**: Menacing by stalking, which can also result in stalking-based protection orders under a different statute.

Federal law also matters:

- **18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8)**: Federal prohibition on firearm possession while subject to a qualifying protection order. Violations are federal felonies.

## Next Steps: What You Should Do Now

If you've been served with an ex parte protection order:

1. **Do not contact the petitioner.** No exceptions.
2. **Preserve all evidence.** Texts, emails, witnesses, documents—everything.
3. **Comply with all terms of the order**, including firearm surrender.
4. **Contact an attorney immediately.** The full hearing is coming fast, and you need to be ready.
5. **Write down everything you remember** about the alleged incidents, including dates, times, witnesses, and context.

The full hearing is your chance to fight back. But you need a solid defense, and you need someone who knows how to handle these cases in Delaware and Franklin County courts.

## Conclusion

Ex parte protection orders are frustrating, disruptive, and often feel like a miscarriage of justice. You were never heard, but your life changed anyway. You lost access to your home, your kids, your firearms, and maybe your reputation—all based on one person's allegations.

But the ex parte stage is temporary. The full hearing is where the real fight happens. If the petitioner's case is weak, exaggerated, or fabricated, you have a chance to prove it. You have a chance to cross-examine, present your evidence, and tell your side of the story.

We've handled these cases. We know what works. We know how to prepare, how to question, and how to present a defense that protects your rights and your future.
