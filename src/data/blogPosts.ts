    title: 'Understanding OVI/DUI Charges in Ohio',
    excerpt: 'Learn about the differences between OVI and DUI charges in Ohio, potential penalties, and how proper defense can protect your record.',
    content: `Operating a vehicle under the influence (OVI) is the legal term Ohio uses for what many other states call DUI (Driving Under the Influence). Whether you're facing a first offense or have prior convictions, understanding the charges and penalties is critical.

## What is OVI in Ohio?

OVI stands for "Operating a Vehicle Impaired." You can be charged with OVI if you operate any vehicle—car, motorcycle, boat, or even bicycle—while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both.

## Penalties for OVI

First-time OVI offenses can result in:
- 3 days to 6 months in jail
- Fines ranging from $375 to $1,075
- License suspension from 6 months to 3 years
- Mandatory alcohol or drug treatment programs
- Ignition interlock device installation

## How We Can Help

At Mango Law, we challenge every aspect of an OVI charge:
- Validity of the traffic stop
- Proper administration of field sobriety tests
- Calibration and accuracy of breathalyzer equipment
- Chain of custody for blood samples
- Officer training and testimony

Early intervention is key. Contact us immediately if you've been charged with OVI.`,

    title: 'The Power of Motion Practice in Criminal Defense',
    excerpt: 'Discover how strategic pre-trial motions can suppress evidence, dismiss charges, or significantly improve your case outcome.',
    content: `Motion practice is one of the most powerful tools in criminal defense. Many cases are won or significantly improved before trial through properly crafted and argued motions.

## What Are Pre-Trial Motions?

Pre-trial motions are formal requests filed with the court asking for specific rulings before your case goes to trial. These can challenge the admissibility of evidence, the legality of searches and seizures, or even the validity of the charges themselves.

## Common Defense Motions

### Motion to Suppress Evidence
If law enforcement violated your constitutional rights during a search or seizure, we can file a motion to suppress that evidence. Without key evidence, prosecutors often must reduce charges or dismiss the case entirely.

### Motion to Dismiss
When charges lack legal foundation or were improperly filed, a motion to dismiss can end your case without trial.

### Motion in Limine
These motions prevent prejudicial or irrelevant evidence from being presented to a jury, ensuring you receive a fair trial.

## Why Motion Practice Matters

Effective motion practice can:
- Result in evidence suppression that weakens the prosecution's case
- Lead to charge reduction or dismissal
- Establish favorable legal precedents for trial
- Demonstrate preparation and seriousness to prosecutors
- Save you time, money, and stress

    title: 'Drug Possession vs. Trafficking: Understanding Ohio Drug Crime Charges',
    excerpt: 'Learn the critical differences between possession and trafficking charges in Ohio, and how these distinctions affect your defense strategy.',
    content: `Ohio drug laws distinguish between simple possession and drug trafficking, with dramatically different penalties and defense strategies required for each charge.

## Drug Possession in Ohio

Possession charges apply when you're found with controlled substances for personal use. Penalties depend on:
- The type of drug (schedule)
- The amount possessed
- Your criminal history
- Whether aggravating circumstances exist

## Drug Trafficking Charges

Trafficking involves the sale, distribution, or intent to distribute controlled substances. Unlike many states, Ohio doesn't require proof of actual sale—possession of certain quantities creates a presumption of trafficking.

## Key Factors in Trafficking Charges

### Amount Matters
Ohio has specific weight thresholds called "bulk amounts" that trigger trafficking charges. For example:
- 5 grams or more of cocaine
- 1 gram or more of heroin
- 200 grams or more of marijuana

### Circumstantial Evidence
Prosecutors often rely on:
- Large amounts of cash
- Scales or baggies
- Multiple cell phones
- Text messages suggesting sales

## Defense Strategies

### For Possession Cases
- Challenge the legality of the search
- Question chain of custody
- Explore diversion programs
- Negotiate for treatment instead of jail

### For Trafficking Cases
- Argue against trafficking presumptions
- Challenge quantity measurements
- Dispute intent to distribute
- Examine confidential informant reliability

## Treatment Alternatives

Ohio offers intervention in lieu of conviction for eligible defendants. This can result in charges being dismissed after completing a treatment program.

## Why You Need Experienced Defense

Drug charges carry mandatory penalties in many cases, and prosecutors aggressively pursue convictions. At Mango Law, we've successfully defended hundreds of drug cases by challenging search procedures, questioning lab results, and negotiating favorable outcomes.
