      'With my OVI case I was very worried at first; I had no idea what was going to happen. As the process moved along, Nick (Dominic) was very professional and confident in his representation with my case. This provided a lot of certainty for me. He was able to get me a fair deal, which allowed me to move on and focus on the future. I highly recommend Dominic "Nick" Mango to anyone that likes working with good honest people.',
